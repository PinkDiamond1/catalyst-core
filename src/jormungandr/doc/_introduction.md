# Jormungandr, the rust node

JÃ¶rmungandr refers to _Midgard Serpent_ in the Norse mythology. It is a hint to
_Ouroboros_, the Ancient Egypt serpent, which is eating its own tail and the
[IOHK paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf) on proof of stake.

But in less specific mythical terms, here, **Jormungandr** will refer to the Node,
the software implementing ouroboros protocols (the blockchain protocols running
cardano).
